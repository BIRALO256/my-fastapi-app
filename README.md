# FastAPI Demo for Model Prediction

This project demonstrates how to create a FastAPI application that serves a trained machine learning model for predictions. The FastAPI app will be used to expose an API endpoint, which can be consumed by a Vue.js web application and a mobile application. The machine learning model used in this project is trained for predicting certain outcomes (e.g., predicting potato diseases based on images, or any other prediction task).

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a simple demo API that allows other applications (like the frontend Vue app and mobile app) to consume the trained model and make predictions. This setup is part of my learning journey to better understand how backend APIs work, especially when integrating machine learning models with web and mobile applications.

## Features

- Exposes an API endpoint for predictions using the trained model.
- Can be consumed by a Vue.js app or mobile app (via HTTP requests).
- Provides a simple way to demonstrate how a trained model can be integrated into an API.
